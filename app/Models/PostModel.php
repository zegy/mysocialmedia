    // The Model does not provide a perfect interface to the Query Builder.
    // The Model and the Query Builder are separate classes with different purposes.
    // Example : "select()" and "join()" is part of Query Builder, "find()" and "paginate()" is part of Model.
    // Query Builder methods and Modelâ€™s CRUD methods can be in the same chained call.
